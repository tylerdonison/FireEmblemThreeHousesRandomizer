# Overview

The purpose of this program is to rewrite a program that was once written in Python, and "translate" it into Kotlin, using the syntax of the basics of Kotlin.

This program is a Randomizer for the Nintendo game: Fire Emblem: Three Houses for the Nintendo Switch.

The randomizer first generates a list of available units that the user can use in the game, including random recruited students and non-students. The amounts of these recruits is chosen by the user. Afterwards, the randomizer will then assign each character self-imposed rules for the user to use in a playthrough of Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Currently these self-imposed rules include generated a list of two weapon proficiencies and a class proficiency.
